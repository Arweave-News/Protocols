# AMA Protocol

Arweave AMA protocol is an on-chain questions gathering method built on the permaweb of Arweave.

# The Why

-  Proof of Transparency.
-  Permanent AMA records.
-  Map question to user (wallet a -> question a).
-  Prevent bots spam, fake forms.

# How it Works
**A) AMA creation:**
AMAs are created from a unique wallet owned by ArweaveNews team.

address: `gLiSx5agTs1qgDfsUNelHQXno8qHl8G_48FNcmB3KJs`

AMA ID component: `A_B_C`

- A: AMA title (type: String). defined by ArweaveNews
- B: timestamp: `Date.now()`
- C: fixed string, value: `AMA`

**B) User's task:**
After creating the AMA ID and posting the transaction in the permaweb, ArweaveNews team announce the AMA ID in its social media platforms (e.g. Twitter).

AMA round length: 96h. Questions after the round's end will not be counted.
